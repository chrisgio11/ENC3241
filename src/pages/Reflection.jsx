        Building my digital portfolio has been a rewarding process so far. I’ve made steady progress in organizing my sections and integrating professional content. I’m very satisfied with the overall layout and navigation. The darker color scheme gives it a modern and professional tone that reflects my style, while maintaining readability and accessibility. The structure feels cohesive, and the navigation between pages is smooth and intuitive, allowing visitors to easily explore my education, skills, and accomplishments.

        Through this project, I’ve learned a lot about both web design and self-presentation. Creating this portfolio pushed me to refine how I communicate my technical experience and showcase my achievements clearly. The most challenging part has been balancing visual design with responsive formatting and accessibility standards. To continue improving, I plan to use resources like online accessibility tools, design documentation for frameworks like Tailwind, and feedback from my instructor, Professor Stapleton. Overall, this portfolio has helped me grow my technical, creative, and professional writing skills in a meaningful way.
